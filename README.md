## Challenge

AUTOMATICALLY FILL OUT ADDRESSES

We currently have a form which allows our users to fill out their address:

We want these fields to be pre-populated depending on the data the user enters.

On https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/registre-national-des-localites-et-des-rues/ you find the "caclr.zip" file which includes all the addresses in Luxembourg.

## Specifications

- [ ] Import the addresses into a database
- [x] Modify the form so the City is a select box. When the user enters a Postal code, the City select values change depending on the Postal Code entered.
- [ ] Modify the form so the Street is a select box. When the user selects a City, the Street select values change depending on the City selected.
- [ ] Modify the form so the Number is a select box. When the user selects a Street, the Number select values change depending on the Street selected.
- [x] New Rails 6.1 or 7 application
